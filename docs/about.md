## Background

We considered various drawing packages, as well as more specialised mind mapping tools (such as Inspiration and MindManager). In the end we choose to use Compendium, a visual representation tool, originally developed for enabling group argumentation, which was produced by researchers at our own institution. We selected Compendium for a number of reasons:

*   It was produced at the Open University, we felt there was more opportunity for further tool development specifically in terms of learning design requirements.
*   Compendium supports the creation of a range of visual mapping techniques, including mind maps, concept maps, web maps and argumentation maps which we felt offered the potential for a range of flexible approaches to the design process.
*   The source code was available under an open source licence.

CompendiumLD is a specialised version of [Compendium](http://compendium.open.ac.uk/institute/about.htm), the mind mapping or argumentation software that provides a default set of icons for creating maps to visualise the connections between ideas. All the facilities provided by Compendium are included within CompendiumLD.
