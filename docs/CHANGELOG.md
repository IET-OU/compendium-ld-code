<div id="v113">

### <a name="version113" ></a>CompendiumLD version 1.13

CompendiumLD version 1.13 released for Windows, Mac and Linux | _2011-03-04 09:26:29 GMT_.

*   Bugs fixed related to task timing, cutting and pasting of nodes, scaling of learning design nodes, dragging and and dropping of image files
*   Link colours now described by colour names (_red, green_ etc.) instead of link types (_responds to, supports_ etc.)
*   Option to export SVG introduced, but the SVG is a single level only, and is a visual but not semantic representation of the maps contents.

</div>

<div id="v10">

### <a name="version10" ></a>CompendiumLD version 1.0

CompendiumLD version 1.0 released for Windows, Mac and Linux | _2010-05-05 16:55:37 BST_.

*   Export of XML files conforming to the standard Compendium DTD enabled via the ‘_Export to XML option_’.
  Un-tick the ‘_Include learning design timing data_’ to export a standard Compendium XML file
  which can be imported into other versions of [Compendium](http://compendium.open.ac.uk/).
  These files will not include learning design timing information.
*   ‘How do I get started with CompendiumLD?’ map edited so that it links to HTML tutorials rather than pdfs.

</div>

<div id="v098">

### <a name="version098" ></a>CompendiumLD version 0.98

CompendiumLD version 0.98 released for Windows, Mac and Linux | _2010-03-26 17:21:22 GMT_.

*   Learning design stencil edited and reduced to a set of four stencils:
  `LD-OU` (_core learning design stencil_),
  `LD-CONDITIONAL` (_to add conditions and different pathways to a learning design_),
  Sequence mapping (_a stencil to help with laying out of learning activities_),
  Approaches to LD (_examples of approaches to learning design, each map shows a different approach to the design process_)
*   Bug in new link drawing code fixed: export as JPEG and HTML now works correctly.
*   Bug fixed in show/hide task times (called via menu option)
*   Help menu changed to refer to online help movies page

<div id="v095">

### <a name="version095" ></a>CompendiumLD version 0.95

CompendiumLD v0.95 for Windows and Mac released | _2010-03-26 17:21:22 GMT_.

*   New learning design node icons introduced for the activity, conditional and task sequence/swim-lane stencils
*   Link drawing improved: links now start and stop very close to the node icons, and move around node indicators (e.g. the label, weight, timing, detail and [transclusion][] indicators).
*   Activity and task timing information is not shown by default. Now need to right click in an activity and select '_Show task times_' to display it.
*   New welcome map introduced ‘_How do I get started with CompendiumLD?_’
*   When projects are created, the nominated user is made the default user
*   LD help – activities found now created transclusions of existing activities
*   Small icon display fixed. To show a small icon for an individual node, select the node and click the button on the node format toolbar.
  To create small icons by default select the menu option: _Tools->Project Options->Node Extras ->'Use small icon'_.
  Note that once you select this option, small icons will be created until you deselect it.
*   Change learning design node type menu introduced.
*   Paste and paste special menu options introduced – copying and pasting works similarly to other applications, except for activity nodes.
*   Menus changed so that menu options used less frequently by most users are hidden by default
*   Inbox removed from home window
*   Introduced menu options to import and export learning design files
*   Bug fixed in Aerial view
