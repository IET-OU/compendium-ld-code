CompendiumLD version 1.13 released for Windows, Mac and Linux.

</div>

<div id="v10">

### <a name="version10" id="version10"></a>CompendiumLD version 1.0 | 2010-05-05 16:55:37 BST

CompendiumLD version 1.0 released for Windows, Mac and Linux.

*   Export of XML files conforming to the standard Compendium DTD enabled via the ‘Export to XML option’.

These files will not include learning design timing information.
*   ‘How do I get started with CompendiumLD?’ map edited so that it links to HTML tutorials rather than pdfs.

<div id="v098">

### <a name="version098" id="version098"></a>CompendiumLD version 0.98 | 2010-03-26 17:21:22 GMT

CompendiumLD version 0.98 released for Windows, Mac and Linux.

*   Learning design stencil edited and reduced to a set of four stencils: LD-OU (core learning design stencil), LD-CONDITIONAL (to add conditions and different pathways to a learning design), Sequence mapping (a stencil to help with laying out of learning activities), Approaches to LD (examples of approaches to learning design, each map shows a different approach to the design process)
*   Bug in new link drawing code fixed: export as Jpg and HTML now works correctly.
*   Bug fixed in show/hide task times (called via menu option)
*   Help menu changed to refer to online help movies page

<div id="v095">

### <a name="version095" id="version095"></a>CompendiumLD version 0.95 | 2010-01-28 13:08:51 GMT

CompendiumLDv0.95 for Windows and Mac released.

*   New learning design node icons introduced for the activity, conditional and task sequence/swim-lane stencils
*   Link drawing improved: links now start and stop very close to the node icons, and move around node indicators (e.g. the label, wieight, timing, detail and transclusion indicators).
*   Activity and task timing information is not shown by default. Now need to right click in an activity and select 'Show task times' to display it.
*   New welcome map introduced ‘How do I get started with CompendiumLD?’
*   When projects are created, the nominated user is made the default user
*   LD help – activities found now created transclusions of existing activities
*   Small icon display fixed. To show a small icon for an individual node, select the node and click the button on the node format toolbar. To create small icons by default select the menu option :Tools->Project Options->Node Extras ->'Use small icon'. Note that once you select this option, small icons will be created until you deselect it.
*   Change learning design node type menu introduced.
*   Paste and paste special menu options introduced – copying and pasting works similarly to other applications, except for activity nodes.
*   Menus changed so that menu options used less frequently by most users are hidden by default

*   Introduced menu options to import and export learning design files
*   Bug fixed in Aerial view
