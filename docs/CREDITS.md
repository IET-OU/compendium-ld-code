## Project partners

 * [Reading University][] — Maria Papaefthimou

 * [Brunel University][] — Dr Phil Alberts, Natalie Parnis, Anu Sharma and Dr Juliette Stephenson

 * **London South Bank University**	— Ruth Brown

 * **Cambridge University**	— Dr. Amyas Phillips

 * **Leicester University**	— Prof. Gráinne Conole

As part of the JISC Curriculum Design project ([OULDI-JISC][]), four other HE institutions
(Brunel, Cambridge, London South Bank and Reading Universities) have been
trialing and exploring the use of the OU learning design methodology.
The purpose of these pilots is to determine the transferability of the OU methodology across a range of different HE organisations.
In addition the pilots will provide the project with valuable feedback about the tools and resources
developed as part of the [OULDI-JISC][] project, and the approaches we have used to introduce and embed
the methodologies institutionally (workshops, special interest groups and the toolbox etc).
These Universities previously worked together as a cluster group for the HEA Pathfinder Project,
on which _Gráinne Conole_ was critical friend and it is expected that this work will build on, and extend on, that project.

In addition we have been working with the LAMS group and are looking forward to continuing to work with Gráinne and her new team at Leicester University.
