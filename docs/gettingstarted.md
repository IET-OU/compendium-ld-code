# Getting Started

This page is intended to get you started quickly. It describes how to install CompendiumLD and gives a brief introduction to using it.

If you want a more detailed guide, please have a look at these [tutorials](documentation/version1.0/tutorials/).

### System requirements

CompendiumLD is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. For more details, full system requirements are described in the [read me file](documentation/readme/ReadMe.html) which is also included in the installation directory when CompendiumLD is installed.

### Installing CompendiumLD

To install CompendiumLD, first [download the installer](download.html), then run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Note that this process should take about 5 minutes on the OU network or equivalent fast connection. You will need an additional 5 mins and be prompted to restart your machine if you have not previously installed Java version 5 (or above).

### Creating a CompendiumLD project

After you have installed CompendiumLD, the first time you run it you will be prompted to create a project to store your designs. We suggest you use the following guidelines to fill in the required information

* **Project Name**: anything you like (e.g. _Fred’s learning designs_)
* **Make this your default project**: if you tick this, CompendiumLD will always select this project to be opened when it starts. We suggest you tick this box.
* **Make the user below the default user**: this user will be the one whose details are used by default to open projects. We suggest you tick this box.
* **Author name**: your name
* **Description**: Anything you like, leave blank if you want
* **Login name**: for OU staff and [ALs][] — your [OUCU][], for other people — anything you like!
* **Password**: anything you like, but for OU staff we recommend that for this prototype you do not use your OU password if you are using CompendiumLD on a non-OU machine, i.e. a machine to which access is not enabled by your OUCU/password combination.

Once you have completed all the fields, press the '_Create_' button and a new project will be created and some default data loaded in.
You will then be presented with the project login dialog and if you have chosen a default project and
user as suggested above you will be able to click '_OK_' to login to that project and begin using CompendiumLD.
